      h1 I'm A Rails Developer
      p
        | My name is Danny Sperry and I'm a bike commuting, enjoyably sarcastic web and iOS developer. In the last year I've contributed to 40+ new and existing projects at FINE. I've proven I have an apptitude to jump into an existing project quickly with good results.<br><br>
        | I get most excited about new projects though. These are opportunities to learn the most, and I personally prefer the fast track to bettering myself. I've built gems, engines, test suites on existing apps, and generic apps with Rails & Sinatra.<br><br>
        | I attended an iOS bootcamp and have been keeping up to date with Swift in order to hit the ground running with a junior iOS position.

            p
              | I'm not the kind of person that wants to be tied to any one language. I'm more concerned about the design of code than I am the language that is used. With that being said, I do most of my work in Rails.

              | A lot of the work I do is in Rails, but I personally believe that Rails is only great because of Ruby. This site was built with Sinatra.
