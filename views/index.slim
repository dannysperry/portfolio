        | My name is Danny Sperry and live the remote worker dream. This wouldn't be possible without email and Slack. I have a few years of production experience. I have an apptitude to jump into an existing project and identify problem areas as well as prioritize them.<br><br>
        | I get most excited about new projects though. These are opportunities to learn the most, and I personally prefer the fast track to bettering myself.<br><br>
        | Writing and deploying code that is tested and linted is a must!

              | I'm not the kind of person that wants to be tied to any one language. I'm more concerned about the design of code than I am the language that is used. With that being said, I do most of my work in Rails.
